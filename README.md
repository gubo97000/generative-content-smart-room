## Description

“Explora!” is a highly interactive and immersive experience for the Magic Room, catered toward atypical and typical children - aged 6-12 years old - to develop their explorative, collaborative and communication skills.

This is a game for 2 players set in the woods, next to a river, and it consists in exploring an idyllic landscape to discover its hidden secrets, by interacting with the elements present in the surrounding environment.

All the interactions are full-body, tracked by a kinect sensor, and can result in a change on the floor or front projections of the room; the children are challenged to understand the causes and effects of each gesture performed, in order to find a way of progressing through the game.

The children are also motivated to collaborate and socialize with each other, thanks to a few collaborative tasks that are needed to progress; also, they are encouraged to teamwork in discovering new things, in an environment that is unknown “a priori” to them, and full of surprises.
